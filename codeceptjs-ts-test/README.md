## Project structure

This project is organized as follows:

| Main folders         | Description |
|---                   |---          |
| `.`                  | Root folder where the configuration files are located |
| `./functional-tests` | Folder where the actual tests are located, as specified in `codecept.conf.ts` file |

|---                                    |---          |
| `npm run test:desktop:chrome:wip`     | In order to isolate a run for a specific test, we should add the `@wip` tag in that particular test scenario |
| `npm run test:desktop:chrome`         | Run all test cases with the tag `@desktop` in the Chrome browser with a Desktop emulation |
| `npm run test:desktop:safari`         | Run all test in the Safari browser with a Desktop emulation |
| `npm run test:desktop:chrome:workers` | Run tests in parallel |
